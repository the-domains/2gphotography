  And there they were, two visions of beauty, standing before me. Gorgeous
  bodies glistening in the sun by the pool. All eyes on them and hot and sweaty
  photographer, me, melting in the hot August sun during a very humid Florida
  day.

And there they were, two visions of beauty, standing before me. Gorgeous bodies glistening in the sun by the pool. All eyes on them and hot and sweaty photographer, me, melting in the hot August sun during a very humid Florida day.

This did not "just" happen. This is not luck. This is the culmination of six years of studying photography, of being in the right place, of having the right gear, of knowing the right people, of offering help to someone in need, of making new friends. This is work, cooperation, collaboration and paying attention to the minutia. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/45addbf0-cb68-4d4b-ba6d-6b0302a5ab04.jpg)

Ultimately, this is love. Love for the process. Love of the subjects, Goddess Phoenix and Goddess Amadahy. And love for you. To capture and share this sensual, sexual, beauty with you, is my attempt to make your world better. To put a smile on your face. To make you say, "Wow!" To make you dream. To motivate you. 

So you, now in a hopefully better mood and attitude towards life, carry this vibrance into your day and affect the lives of those around you for the better.

These photos are a pebble in the pond. Their ripples reaching shores far beyond their immediately visible reach. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7279b880-3f41-459a-a165-a60623d0f8d4.jpg)

Now you know the intention. Now you know the mission.
